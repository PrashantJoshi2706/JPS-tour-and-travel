//Dynamic[Bottom up] algorithm for the "maximum profit earn by broker in share market"


 //Here price is price table of share's showing it's daily price
 // n is no of day whose price given in price table
 // k is how many maximum time's share can buy and sell for the maximum profit

   maxprofit(price,n,k)

1.|   profit [k+1][n+1]  // stores the maximum profit of atmos k+1 transaction up to n+1 day

2.|   for i = 0 to i <= k
